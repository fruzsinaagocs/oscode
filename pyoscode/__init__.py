    Parameters
    ----------
    ts: numpy.ndarray [float] or list [float]
       An array of real numbers representing the values of the independe
       nt variable at which the frequency and friction term are evaluated. 

    ws: numpy.ndarray [complex] or list [complex]
       An array-like object of real or complex 
       numbers, representing the values of frequency w at the points given in ts.

    gs: numpy.ndarray [complex] or list [complex]
        An array-like object of real or complex numbers representing the values
        of the friction term g at the points given in ts.

    ti,tf: float
        Start and end of integration range.

    x0, dx0: complex
        Initial values of the dependent variable and its derivative.

    logw, logg: boolean, optional
        If true, the array of frequencies and friction values, respectively, will be
        exponentiated (False, False by default).

    order: int, optional
        Order of WKB approximation to use, 3 (the highest value) by default.
    
    rtol, atol: float, optional
        Relative and absolute tolerance of the solver, 1e-4 and 0 by default.
        Note that atol at the moment is not implemented. 

    h: float, optional
        Size of the initial step, 1 by default.

    full_output: str , optional
        If given, the return dictionary will be written to a file with the supplied
        name.
    
    Returns
    -------
    A dictionary with the following keywords and values:

        sol: list [complex]
            A list containing the solution evaluated at timepoints listed under
            the 't' keyword.

        dsol: list [complex]
            A list containint the first deriv ative of the solution evaluated at
            timepoints listed under the 't' keyword.

        t: list [float]
            Contains the values of the independent variable where the solver
            stepped, i.e. evaluated the solution at. This is not determined by
            the user, rather these are the internal steps the solver naturally
            takes when integrating.

        types: list [float]
            A list of True/False values corresponding to the step types the
            solver chose at the timepoints listed under the keyword 't'. If
            True, the step was WKB, and RK otherwise.
